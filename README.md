# env-var-review
 
This repo contains the work for a review of the effects of resource abundance and environmental variance on animals' space use supported by simulations.

* `analysis` contains all scripts used for analyses, including figure creation and model fitting. Scripts contain comments that explain the code, but they assume users have basic knowledge of `R` and that they will refer to help pages for packages and functions (which can be accessed with `?`, e.g.: `?data.frame`).
* `data` contains all datasets not publicly available elsewhere.
* `figures` contains all figures used in this project. The scripts used to create the figures can be found in the `analysis/figures` folder.
* `functions` contains all custom functions sourced in analysis scripts.
* `issues` contains all files related to issues with the project and repository. Please report any reproducibility issues as an issue on the repository.
* `models` contains all model saved as `.rds` files, except for models which are too large to store on GitHub. All models can be fit using the scripts in the `analysis/models` folder.
* `writing` contains all files used to create the final manuscript.
